# Online markets for illicit drugs in Georgia

## Replication code and source data

This repository contains the source data and replication code for the report "Online markets for illicit drugs in Georgia". The repository consists of the following files and folders:
- [scrape.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/scrape.py): the scraper for Matanga. This ceased working and was repaired periodically throughout the study as changes to Matanga broke the script. It has not been updated since ceasing functioning in mid-August 2020 and will require further adjustment to operate.
- [clean.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/clean.py): consolidation of data and post processing
- [sales.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/sales.py): sales estimation function, called from [clean.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/clean.py)
- [utils.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/utils.py): utility functions, used to avoid cluttering [clean.py](https://github.com/crrcgeorgia/matanga/blob/master/clean.py)
